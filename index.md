## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Bio and Brain Engineering (BBE) at KAIST, co-advised by Prof. [Jong Chul Ye](https://bispl.weebly.com/) and Prof. [Sang Wan Lee](https://aibrain.kaist.ac.kr/). I recently worked as a Research Scientist Intern at [Meta Reality Labs](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/) (London) in the 2025 summer.

My research focuses on controllable generative models, particularly diffusion models. I am especially interested in a universal Diffusion-X framework: (a) distills foundational knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to downstream tasks (DM&rarr;X) and (b) enables interpretable, reliable, and versatile posterior sampling (X&rarr;DM).
