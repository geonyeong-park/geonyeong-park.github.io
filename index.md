## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Bio and Brain Engineering (BBE) at KAIST, with a strong desire to become a tech-based leader in AI. Fortunately co-advised by Prof. [Jong Chul Ye](https://bispl.weebly.com/) and Prof. [Sang Wan Lee](https://aibrain.kaist.ac.kr/). Completed M.S. in BBE at KAIST, advised by Prof. Sang Wan Lee. I am especially interested in bridging the gap between human perception and AI models, primarily focusing on improving AI generalization. In particular, my recent research focuses on (**1**) developing **adaptation** algorithms that distill and compose essential prior knowledge from foundational models, (**2**) ensuring **fairness & robustness** in the face of distribution shifts, and (**3**) refining the **alignment** across multiple modalities in generative models.

## Research Interests

- **Generative models:** Diffusion models and their applications. (Editing, Inverse imaging, etc)
- **Multi-modal learning:** Text, Image, Video, 3D, etc.
- **Attention mechanism:** Modern transformer and its connection to associative memory models.
- **Fair & robust learning:** Adversarial vulnerability, Debiasing, Transfer learning.

## News

- **[Jun. 2024]** [CFG++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08070v1) is available on arxiv. A simple fix to CFG that enables lower guidance scales, improves sample quality and invertibility.
- **[Mar. 2024]** [Dreamsampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11415), [DreamMotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12002), [Treg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15658) is available on arxiv.
- **[Mar. 2024]** Three papers ([Self-supervised debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05248), [VMC](https://video-motion-customization.github.io/), [CDS](https://hyelinnam.github.io/CDS/)) accepted at CVPR 2024.
